# CEI-website
The open - source website for CEI

Installation Instructions: 

1. Make sure you have Node installed.

2. Clone the repo and run `npm install`

3. Install the Live Server Extension for VSCode. 

[This is subject to change soon. npm live-server isn't working properly as of yet, so this is a workaround]

4. Right - CLick on `index.html` and choose `Open with Live Server`
